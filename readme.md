### This is a super *(duper)* experimental branch
I'm in the early stages of learning React, and I'd like to update this p5node project to use it eventually. Wish me luck (~:

------

A (mostly) blank project that renders a simple page containing a p5js sketch.

This project is currently maintained only for my own use. I will update with features I find useful.

Installation is easy. Navigate to your desired directory, then:
1. Clone and switch the react branch
```
git clone https://github.com/StinkyDubeau/p5node.git
cd p5node
git checkout react
```
2. Install packages
```
npm i
```
3. Run react's dev environment
```
npm start
```

The app is running at localhost:3000 by default.
